# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analyis was to use matplotlib to analyze data and create compelling visualizations to showcase the relationships between various city types and other factors such as driver count, total/average fares, rider count and so in order to help the company, Pyber to determine their affordability in certain neighbourhoods and improve access to their ride sharing services.

## Results

From the data obtained in thesummary DataFrame (Summary DataFrame.png), the urban city types had the highest amount of drivers and rides in total followed by the suburban and finally the rural had the least of all 3. From the line graph plotted (PyBer_fare_summary.png), the total fares over time between all three city types also correlate with the previous results - the highest fare amounts belong to the urban city type followed by the suburban and finally the rural respectively. 
The rural city types had the highest average fares of all three for both per ride and per driver. These results could be explained by the fact that riders in the rural and suburban city types are willing to pay higher fares due to the driver count not being very high as in the case of the urban cities.

## Summary

Based on the results obtained above, some recommendations I would like to make to improve the business include:

- Allocating more drivers to the rural cities especially seeing how in-demand the need for drivers are, this will make the company more profits in the long-run.
- Focusing on increasing driver count around the end of February leading into March for all city types and also in April (for the rural and urban cities especially) as those are two time-periods were there seemed to be an increase in average fare amounts.
- Making an increase in the fare amounts charged in the urban cities would also be very profitable as those cities already have more in terms of driver volume and ride counts. Therefore more people paying higher fare amounts leads to increase in revenue.
